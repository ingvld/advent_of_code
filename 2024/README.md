Inputs in folder /inputs on the form 1-input or 1-test-1 for the inputs of 1st of December, with -1 or -2 for the test data depending on which part the test data is from (generally most days only have -1). My personal inputs excluded here.

Run with `cargo run 1 1 -t`, for running the solution for dec 1. part 1. The -t flag is optional and means you'll use test data rather than the full input data.
